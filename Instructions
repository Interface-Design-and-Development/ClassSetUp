Now that you have read a bit about GitHub and how it works, we want to make sure you can use it.

Below is a short sequence of numbers. Using a pull request, change the sequence of digits to be sorted in ascending order.

6 34 9 4 9567 345 11 2

Once you have edited the list, click the "commit changes..." button in the upper right hand corner.

You should now be able to hover over the sequence above and see the change you made.

Pull requests are like little updates to the code, and being able to see each individual change is valuable when debugging and fixing issues that come up.

For the rest of these instructions, please add a new file to this repository by clicking the create button on the repository's homepage.
